**Project Summary:** New Harvest is a restaurant located in Beacon Falls, CT. I developed a professional and clean website for the restaurant that effectively showcases what the establishment has to offer customers. 

**Implementation Steps:** The New Harvest restaurant in Beacon Falls, CT, had a Wix website that was difficult to navigate and visually unappealing. My goal was to create a more user-friendly and professional solution. Key features of the new website included an easy-to-read menu, the restaurant's location, and a link to the Facebook page for upcoming events.

To begin, I researched the design of other restaurant websites to establish a polished look. After drafting several ideas and themes, I settled on a design and built the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also incorporated Bootstrap to build the navigation bar.

The gallery page was the most intricate, employing flexbox to create a grid layout that adapts to a column format on mobile devices. It features a JavaScript lightbox that enhances the user experience by allowing for easier viewing and navigation between images. Additionally, all images were neatly organized in the HTML to ensure readability and facilitate future maintenance.

Upon completion, the website achieved its intended functionality and aesthetic goals, resulting in a clean, professional design that is easy to navigate.
